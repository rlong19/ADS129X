# ADS129X

Driver and sketches for the Texas Instruments **ADS1299-4 / ADS1299-6 / ADS1299** on a **Teensy 3.6, 4.0, or 4.1**, plus a Classic-Bluetooth sketch for the **original ESP32** (ESP32-WROOM-32E or ESP32-PICO, for example the Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2).

The photographed carrier is a Teensy 4.0 stacked on an **ADS1299-6**. The firmware reads the ID register and uses that channel count. If the ID does not look like an ADS1299, it assumes **6 channels**. Host output is still an **8-channel OpenBCI packet**; channels the chip does not have are zero.

This follows the ADS1299 datasheet (SBAS499C), not the ADS1298 ECG defaults. There is no respiration, pace, or Wilson-terminal register. Address `0x15` is `MISC1` (SRB1). Bias is `BIAS_SENSP` / `BIAS_SENSN`.

## Wiring

SPI is **mode 1** (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 1), MSB first. SCLK is requested at **8 MHz** (the part allows 20 MHz at DVDD >= 2.7 V). `MOSI` drives ADS1299 `DIN`. `MISO` reads `DOUT`.

Tie `CLKSEL` high for the internal 2.048 MHz oscillator, and tie `DAISY_IN` to DGND when this is the only device. `PWDN` and `RESET` are active low. Hold `START` low until the sketch starts conversions. DRDY falls when a new frame is ready; the interrupt is falling-edge.

Analog supplies, the bias resistor network, and SRB1/BIASOUT wiring are on the carrier. The firmware turns the internal 4.5 V reference and the bias amplifier on; it does not create that analog network.

### Teensy 3.6, 4.0, and 4.1

These pins are the same on all three boards and match the stacked carrier used by `Serial_OBCI` (DRDY on 2, PWDN on 3, RESET on 5, START on 6, CS on 10). An earlier loose prototype used a different map (PWDN 2, RESET 3, START 4, DRDY 5, CS 10). Confirm the silk before flashing that older board. Override a pin with `-DADS1299_PIN_DRDY=5` (and the matching `ADS1299_PIN_*` names) or by editing the defaults in `ADS129X.h`.

| Teensy pin | ADS1299 pin | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13 (SCK) | SCLK | Hardware SPI. Do not use the onboard LED; it shares this pin. |
| 11 (MOSI) | DIN | |
| 12 (MISO) | DOUT | |
| 10 | CS | Active low, GPIO, not the SPI peripheral's automatic CS. |
| 2 | DRDY | Falling-edge interrupt. |
| 6 | START | Held low during setup, then driven high. |
| 5 | RESET | Active low. Pulsed after the power-up wait. |
| 3 | PWDN | Active low. Driven high to run. |
| GND | DGND, AGND | Common ground. |
| 3.3 V | DVDD | Logic supply. AVDD / AVSS stay on the carrier. |

### Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2 (original ESP32)

This is **not** the stacked Teensy carrier. It is a suggested jumper map for a Feather V2 or any original ESP32 module using these GPIO numbers. ESP32-S2, S3, C3, and C6 are refused: they do not have Bluetooth Classic SPP.

Do not use a DevKit's default VSPI labels (SCK 18, MOSI 23) with this sketch. Wire the GPIOs below. GPIO 34 is input-only and has no internal pull-up; the ADS1299 drives DRDY.

| Feather V2 pin | GPIO | ADS1299 pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SCK | 5 | SCLK |
| MO | 19 | DIN |
| MI | 21 | DOUT |
| 33 | 33 | CS |
| A2 | 34 | DRDY |
| 27 | 27 | START |
| A1 | 25 | RESET |
| A0 | 26 | PWDN |
| GND | GND | DGND / AGND |

## What the chip setup does

1. Drive `PWDN` high and hold `RESET` low, then wait 150 ms (`tPOR` is 128 ms at 2.048 MHz; the datasheet's typical power-up is 150 ms).
2. Release `RESET` and wait 18 `tCLK` (~9 µs). The reset low time is longer than the 2 `tCLK` minimum.
3. Send `SDATAC` before any register access. The part wakes in `RDATAC`, and register reads and writes are ignored until `SDATAC`.
4. Read `ID`. `NU_CH` `00` / `01` / `10` means 4 / 6 / 8 channels. Production IDs are usually `0x3C`, `0x3D`, and `0x3E`.
5. `CONFIG1` keeps the reserved bits set (`0x90 | DR`). Data rates are 250 SPS through 16 kSPS. `111` is not used.
6. `CONFIG3` sets bit 7 so the internal reference buffer is on (`0xE0` plus bias bits). The reference start-up wait is 150 ms.
7. Referential sketches close SRB1 (`MISC1 = 0x20`) and put every present channel into `BIAS_SENSP` and `BIAS_SENSN`.
8. `RDATAC`, then the `START` pin goes high. Samples are read on DRDY falling.
9. A frame is 3 status bytes plus 3 bytes per real channel (27 / 21 / 15). Channel data is 24-bit two's complement, sign-extended to 32 bits in `getData()`. Status bits `[23:20]` should read `1100`.

## OpenBCI packets

`Serial_OBCI`, `Serial_EMG`, and `ESP32_SPP` wait for `b` and then write the [Cyton 33-byte frame](https://docs.openbci.com/Cyton/CytonDataFormat/):

| Bytes | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `0xA0` |
| 1 | Sample number, 0–255, wrapping |
| 2–25 | Eight 24-bit signed channel values, MSB first |
| 26–31 | Zeros (no accelerometer, so this is not live accel data) |
| 32 | `0xC0` |

The GUI's default scale is `µV = count * (4.5 / 8388607 / gain) * 1e6` with gain 24. `Serial_OBCI` and `ESP32_SPP` use that gain and 250 SPS. `Serial_EMG` uses gain 12 and 2 kSPS, so change the GUI scale before trusting its microvolt axis.

Startup text ends with `$$$`. Commands that answer do so only while streaming is off, so a reply cannot land in the middle of a binary packet.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `b` / `s` | Start or stop the binary stream |
| `v` | Reset the ADS1299, rewrite registers, print the banner |
| `V` | Print `ADS129X-2.0.0$$$` |
| `?` | Read back registers `0x00`–`0x17` |
| `xCHPDGAININBIASSRB2SRB1X` | One channel, same character codes as the Cyton SDK |
| `1`–`8` and `!@#$%^&*` | Power a channel down or up. Powered-down inputs are shorted, and the packet channel is zero |
| `d` / `D` | Restore or report the sketch's default channel template |
| `~0` … `~6` or `~~` | Set or query the data rate (`0` = 16 kSPS … `6` = 250 SPS) |

`z...Z` lead-off commands are consumed so the parser stays aligned, and answered with `not implemented`. Daisy-chain, SD logging, and real accelerometer bytes are not implemented.

## Sketches

| Sketch | Board | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/Serial_OBCI` | Teensy | OpenBCI packets. Referential EEG, gain 24, 250 SPS, SRB1 closed, bias on. |
| `examples/Serial_EMG` | Teensy | OpenBCI packets. Differential inputs, gain 12, 2 kSPS, SRB1 open, bias on. |
| `examples/Serial_Plotter` | Teensy | Eight signed counts, space-separated, for the Arduino Serial Plotter. Same analog setup as `Serial_OBCI`. Starts on its own. |
| `examples/Test_Signal` | Teensy | Same text format. Internal ~2 Hz square wave, gain 1. Expect about ±3495 counts (`VREF/2400` into gain 1). |
| `examples/ESP32_SPP` | Original ESP32 | Same EEG setup as `Serial_OBCI`. Packets on USB serial and Bluetooth SPP name `ADS1299-EEG`. Feather V2 pin map. |
| `examples/ESP32_OpenBCI` | ESP32 and ESP32-S3 dev modules | Same EEG setup, plus WiFi (OpenBCI WiFi Shield HTTP/TCP/UDP) and Bluetooth. See below. |

The first conversions after `START` are sinc-filter settling (about 16 ms at 250 SPS). Status is not a plotter column; `getData()` still returns it in `sample[0]`.

## ESP32 WiFi and Bluetooth

`examples/ESP32_OpenBCI` is the dev-board sketch. It is not the Feather map in `ESP32_SPP`. SPI pins are the Arduino defaults for **ESP32 Dev Module** and **ESP32-S3 Dev Module**, and each one is a `#define` (`ADS_PIN_SCLK`, `ADS_PIN_MISO`, `ADS_PIN_MOSI`, `ADS_PIN_CS`, `ADS_PIN_DRDY`, `ADS_PIN_START`, `ADS_PIN_RESET`, `ADS_PIN_PWDN`) so a different board is a build flag or a one-line edit.

| ADS1299 | ESP32 Dev Module | ESP32-S3 Dev Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SCLK | 18 | 12 |
| DIN (MOSI) | 23 | 11 |
| DOUT (MISO) | 19 | 13 |
| CS | 5 | 10 |
| DRDY | 27 | 4 |
| START | 25 | 5 |
| RESET | 26 | 6 |
| PWDN | 32 | 7 |

Leave `STA_SSID` empty and the board starts an access point named `ADS1299-EEG`, password `openbci123`, at **192.168.4.1**. Set `STA_SSID` / `STA_PASSWORD` to join a router instead; if that join fails, it falls back to the same access point. The serial monitor prints the IP. HTTP is port 80.

DRDY is still the sample clock. On ESP32 the GPIO interrupt only wakes a high-priority task (the Arduino SPI driver cannot be called from that interrupt). That task clocks the frame and pushes a 33-byte packet into a 512-deep ring. `loop()` drains the ring onto WiFi and Bluetooth, so a stalled `write` does not have to finish before the next SPI read. `ringDropped()` counts packets that did not fit. The USB line `# ring_dropped=` is printed while USB itself is not streaming binary.

WiFi matches the OpenBCI WiFi Shield enough for BrainFlow and the GUI:

| Request | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /board` | `{"board_connected","board_type":"cyton","num_channels":8,"gains":[...]}` |
| `POST /tcp` | JSON `ip`, `port`, `output` (`raw` or `json`), `delimiter`, `latency`. The ESP32 connects **to that computer** and, once streaming, writes samples. |
| `POST /udp` | Same JSON. One datagram per sample. `"redundancy":true` sends it three times. |
| `POST /command` | `{"command":"~4"}` and the other Cyton ASCII commands. |
| `GET /stream/start` | Starts conversions (`b`). |
| `GET /stream/stop` | Stops them when no other transport still wants samples. |

`raw` output is concatenated 33-byte packets (`0xA0` … `0xC0`). `json` output is one `{"chunk":[{"data":[nanovolts...],"timestamp":...}]}` object per sample, with `\r\n` when `delimiter` is true. BrainFlow asks for `raw`. The `latency` value is accepted and reported; packets are sent on the next `loop()` pass rather than held for that many microseconds.

BrainFlow (the computer listens, the board calls out):

```python
from brainflow.board_shim import BoardShim, BrainFlowInputParams, BoardIds

params = BrainFlowInputParams()
params.ip_address = "192.168.4.1"  # or the STA address printed at boot
params.ip_port = 6677              # free port on this computer
board = BoardShim(BoardIds.CYTON_WIFI_BOARD, params)
board.prepare_session()            # GET /board, POST /tcp, then ~4 (1000 SPS)
board.start_stream()               # GET /stream/start
```

In the OpenBCI GUI choose Cyton over WiFi and enter that IP. `prepare_session` always sends `~4`, so a BrainFlow session runs at **1000 SPS** even though the sketch boots at 250.

Classic Bluetooth SPP is compiled only for the original ESP32 (the S3 has no Classic radio). Pair with `ADS1299-EEG`. The port is a normal serial port: GUI "Cyton (live from serial / dongle)", or BrainFlow `BoardIds.CYTON_BOARD` with `params.serial_port`. Send `b` / `s` as usual.

ESP32-S3 uses BLE Nordic UART under the same name (`6E400001-B5A3-F4F5-A9E5-9E4000000000`). Notifications are 20 bytes so they fit the default ATT MTU; a client has to concatenate them back into 33-byte packets. The OpenBCI GUI does not open a Cyton over BLE. A BLE serial app can send `b` and read the stream.

These rates are from the 33-byte packet and typical radio throughput. They were not measured on hardware.

| Transport | Rate that should fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USB serial at 115200 | 250 SPS | About 11 KB/s on the wire. |
| Classic SPP | 250 SPS, often 1000 | 1000 SPS is 33 KB/s. 2000 SPS is optimistic. |
| BLE notifications | 250 SPS | Two notifications per packet at the default MTU. |
| WiFi TCP | 250 through about 4–8 kSPS | 8 kSPS is about 264 KB/s. 16 kSPS is about 528 KB/s, and the ring is only 32 ms deep at that rate. |
| WiFi UDP | Same order as TCP | Loss is visible as sample-number gaps. Redundancy multiplies the airtime. |

The 512-packet ring is about 2 s at 250 SPS and about 0.5 s at 1000 SPS.

```

From a checkout of this repository (the folder that contains `ADS129X.h`):

```bash

# Default 1.2 MB app partition is too small for WiFi + Bluetooth.
# Huge APP is 3 MB and has no OTA slot. Minimal SPIFFS (1.9 MB) also fits.
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32:PartitionScheme=huge_app --libraries /tmp/ardulibs examples/ESP32_OpenBCI
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3:PartitionScheme=huge_app --libraries /tmp/ardulibs examples/ESP32_OpenBCI
```

In the Arduino IDE, install **Teensy (for Arduino IDE 2.x)** and **esp32** by Espressif, then open a sketch from `examples/`. Pick Teensy 4.0, 4.1, or 3.6, **Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2** for `ESP32_SPP`, or **ESP32 Dev Module** / **ESP32S3 Dev Module** for `ESP32_OpenBCI`. For that last sketch set **Tools → Partition Scheme → Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)**. USB serial on the Feather and on Dev Modules is 115200. Teensy USB serial ignores the baud number.

`examples/ESP32_SPP` does not compile for ESP32-S2/S3/C3/C6 on purpose. `examples/ESP32_OpenBCI` compiles for the original ESP32 and the ESP32-S3.

Checked with arduino-cli, Teensy core 1.62.0, and ESP32 core 3.3.12. No ADS1299 was attached.

| Sketch | Teensy 4.0 | Teensy 4.1 | Teensy 3.6 | Feather ESP32 V2 | ESP32 Dev Module | ESP32-S3 Dev Module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Serial_OBCI | yes | yes | yes | | | |
| Serial_EMG | yes | yes | yes | | | |
| Serial_Plotter | yes | yes | yes | | | |
| Test_Signal | yes | yes | yes | | | |
| ESP32_SPP | | | | yes | yes | |
| ESP32_OpenBCI | | | | | yes (Huge APP) | yes (Huge APP) |

The same four Teensy sketches also compiled for Teensy 3.2 / 3.1 (`teensy:avr:teensy31`). Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 stops in `ESP32_SPP` with the Classic-Bluetooth error. A Dev Module build of `ESP32_SPP` still uses the Feather GPIO numbers in the wiring table above. `ESP32_OpenBCI` on a Dev Module uses the dev-board pins in the ESP32 section.

Nothing in this tree was run on the carrier. Confirm the ID line (`0x3D` for an ADS1299-6), that status bits `[23:20]` are `1100`, and that the test-signal sketch steps by about ±3495 counts before trusting electrode data.
